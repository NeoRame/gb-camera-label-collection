## What can you found here
I try to re-create all GB Camera related Label, for all those who need a replacement one because the Original is broken. I created all Labels as Vector for best resolution.

What Labels have I done?
* Gameboy Camera Label in different Color variation
* Pocket Camera Label in different Color variation
* Various Hello Kitty Labels based on @23kpixels awesome Logo creations (i edit and tweaked some shapes)
* European/Japanes Serialnumber
* US Serialnumber with (working!) Barcode
* US Repair Label
* EUR/US Silver Label
* EUR Custom Silver Labels for [Photo!](https://github.com/untoxa/gb-photo)

I sorted the Images in the Folder Raster and Sources.
* Raster contains all Labels, Color Variations and Region (i have done ;) ) in a Ready to Print, **600DPI** **.png** format.
* Sources contains all Labels in two editable formats: **.ai** and **.psd**. 

Files like the "Silver Label" includes multiple Label. For example, in there you found all you need to do a EUR or US Label.

## Why Sources?
These Files contain a Cutting Mask for all of you guys who own a cutting plotter and cut her own labels, the images also have an 2mm overhang for cut plotter.

## Fonts and usefull stuff.
Fonts you may need:
* Most of all editable Fonts are Arial (Bold)
* for the Barcode you need the Font [Free3of9](https://squaregear.net/fonts/free3of9.html)
* for the Serialnumbers you need "OCRBEF (Regular)"

The Font Free3of9 is working and Scanable, to make it work you have to put your Serialnumber in asterisk (without the space) e.g.: * CE12345678 *

Paper i used to print my Silver Label: [HERMA 4593 - Adhesive Silver Foil Labels](https://amzn.to/3cV1ECB)

## Why there are two Blue Colors?
Blue_NeoRame are the color i picked from my original scan, and after lots of triel and error and many testprints, i matched the original Color
All other colors, based on @23kpixels Label source, are untested and may differ after printing!
